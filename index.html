                                <article class='pAbout'>Although I have only been coding for about four months, I have been learning fulltime.
                                    The mathmatical side of my brain has been missing this type of stimulation.  I very much enjoy solving problems.
                                    I have also benefited greatly from the great community of coders that have helped me along the way.  
                                    I love the feeling that everyone wishes you to succeed.  I want to promote that as well, in my work environment.
                                    It takes a village to raise a child.  I enjoy rapping and taking photos.  Art keeps me going.
